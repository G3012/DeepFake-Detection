# DeepFake-Detection
## Dataset 
**FaceForensics++:** This dataset contains 1000 original video sequences from 977 YouTube videos. All videos feature a trackable front face without occlusions. We used these original videos for our training and testing data. The videos were downloaded from the FaceForensics++ GitHub with a C23 compression rate. (FaceForensics++ )
**DeeperForensics-1.0:** This dataset comprises 11,000 manipulated videos created using various end-to-end face-swapping methods and Deepfake Variational Autoencoder (DF-VAE) methods. The dataset includes seven types of real-world perturbations at five different intensity levels. Our project utilized the 1000 raw manipulated videos generated by DF-VAE end-to-end. These videos were downloaded from the DeeperForensics-1.0 GitHub repository and can be found in the manipulated videos part 00.zip file. (DeeperForensics1.0 )
